### Headers

#### WTF are headers!?
If you don't know what they are then you don't belong here. Go and learn at least a bit of C++.
<br>
#### Where can i get them?
I have a GitHub repository for maintaining headers. Please note that they are incomplete and are not made by me, i only make edits to them.
